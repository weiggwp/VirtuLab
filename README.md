# VirtuLab
:leaves: Simulation Lab Maker

:leaves: Imagine you are a student who has never attended a single lab course, and upon reaching college, you’re
presented your first lab manual. :flushed: You don’t know how to use any of the lab equipment, or how anything in a
laboratory works really, of course. But based on your experience in science classes, you attempt to gauge how
you should interact and handle equipment, without inevitably breaking a few. VirtuLab works in a similar way,
except it simulates this experience without the breaking and spilling. By utilizing VirtuLab, students like you
and I can get the look and feel of an actual lab lesson behind a monitor screen.

:leaves: Now imagine you are a faculty in the science department who is tired of constantly losing equipment and
cleaning up messes because far too many students are unfamiliar with lab procedures. :weary: For that, it would be
helpful to give students a head start, a practice dry run, before they go in and touch the expensive equipment.
This is very similar to how we let children play with cooking mama (simulation for actual cooking) before they
roam freely in the kitchen.
